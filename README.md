ðŸ“Œ Oasis Infobyte Internship â€“ Task 3

Data Cleaning in Google Colab

As part of my Oasis Infobyte Internship, I completed Task 3: Data Cleaning, where I worked on transforming a raw Airbnb NYC dataset into a structured, analysis-ready format.

Key Steps I Performed:

ðŸ§¹ Removed Missing & Duplicate Values to ensure data integrity

ðŸ”  Standardized String Formats for consistency across columns

ðŸ”¢ Converted Data Types (dates, numbers, categories) for accurate processing

ðŸ“Š Handled Outliers to improve analytical accuracy

ðŸ—‚ Renamed Columns & Organized Data for better readability

ðŸ›  Feature Engineering to create new useful columns for future analysis

ðŸ“ˆ Exported the Cleaned Dataset for further Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Why This Matters:

Clean and consistent data forms the foundation for accurate analysis, machine learning models, and business decisions. Without it, even the most advanced algorithms can give misleading results.

ðŸ’¡ Tech Stack Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy in Google Colab
